# Word add-in sample

Think about equations. What seems like the easiest way to get a digital version? You might already be using Microsoft Word to enter all the symbols and characters. But it takes time and it’s definitely slower than just writing on paper.

That’s where we offer added value, with a JavaScript plugin for Word: MyScript Math Sample. You can write your equation directly into the plugin canvas as you would on paper. Your handwriting is recognized in real time and easily editable if needed.  You can export it in Word.

Try it it directly from the [office store]() only take __5 minutes__ to grab the sources and launch this sample in word.
