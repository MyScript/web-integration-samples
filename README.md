# Important things to do in the place where you cloned it!
Run the following commands in command prompt or terminal at the folder's location.
```shell
bower install myscript
```

bower install myscript-text-web
```
```shell
bower install myscript-math-web
```

Then in that same folder run the following command.
```shell
python -m http.server to run server
```
Note if this command doesn't work search [running local testing server!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)
